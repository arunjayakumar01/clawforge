# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

ClawForge is currently in active development. Security fixes are applied to the
latest `main` branch and included in the next release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities in public GitHub issues.

Use one of these private channels instead:

1. GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (preferred): open a report from the
   repository's **Security** tab.
2. If private reporting is unavailable, contact maintainers privately through
   repository ownership contacts and include "Security Vulnerability" in the
   subject.

## What to Include

Please include as much of the following as possible:

- A clear description of the issue and impacted components.
- Reproduction steps or a proof of concept.
- Potential impact and attack scenario.
- Suggested mitigation, if known.

## Response Process

When a valid report is received, maintainers will:

- Acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
- Triage severity and affected versions.
- Work on a fix and coordinate a release.
- Credit the reporter (if desired) after the fix is published.

We ask reporters to avoid public disclosure until a fix is available and users
have had reasonable time to update.
